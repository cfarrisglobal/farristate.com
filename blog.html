                <h1>Weather Prediction Database</h1>
                <h5>August 11th, 2015</h5>

                <p>
                One of my largest personal projects was the creation of a weather prediction database. 
                I was looking to store 7 key metrics that could be used in the future to power Android 
                and IPhone fitness based apps. The full program can be found on my GitHub 
                <a href="https://github.com/cfarrisglobal/WeatherRun">here</a>. I chose the National 
                Weather Service’s NDFD database as my source since it had a free SOAP web service.
                </p>
                <p>
                In the United States there are over 43,000 zip codes and the National Weather Service 
                maintains weather prediction data for each of them. The broad goal of this project 
                was to gather this data and place it into a local MySQL database where it would be 
                easier to access.

                <p>
                If you have travelled downtown or to a central neighborhood in your city recently 
                you may have been surprised by how much construction you saw. Cities like Austin, 
                Portland, and Denver are growing at an accelerated clip since the Great Recession 
                ended six years ago. The suburbs are still growing and more sprawling than ever 
                across the nation but what’s different from the 70s through 90s is that walkable 
                neighborhoods in cities’ central cores are also growing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Jeff Speck is an Urban Designer and most people probably don’t know what an Urban 
                Designer does. That’s not surprising because it is a very small field that doesn't 
                get very much attention.

                <h1>CPU Usage Chart Part 2</h1>
                <h5>July 21st, 2015</h5>
                <h4><p>
                In the previous blog post I went over how the front end displays a chart mapping the % 
                CPU usage of the server running this website. Now I’ll continue by explaining the hidden 
                side of things on the back end. The purpose of the back end is to generate 
                <a href="http://farristate.com/WebsiteChart/myTutorials.txt" target="_blank"> this</a> 
                text file containing the time and % CPU. There are 4 main pieces that make this work 
                starting with the Linux command mpstat.

                My website's hosting server is a virtual private server deployed on Digital Ocean’s cloud. Digital Ocean has a feature for its users to be able to view their server’s CPU usage on a graph. When I first booted up a Digital Ocean server I tried a few things to get this chart to show some activity. The servers I run use the Linux operating system Ubuntu but Ubuntu by itself has a baseline CPU usage somewhere close to 0%. After I uploaded a few old Java programs that had to do some decent calculations I was finally able to move the CPU usage around a little.
                </p>
                <p>
                More recently I decided to try and recreate a simpler version of this chart on my website.
