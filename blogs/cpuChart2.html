                <h1>CPU Usage Chart Part 2</h1>
                <h5>July 21st, 2015</h5>
                <h4><p>
                In the <a href="/blogs/cpuChart.html">previous blog post</a> I went over how the front end displays a chart mapping the % CPU usage of the server running this website. Now I’ll continue by explaining the hidden side of things on the back end. The purpose of the back end is to generate <a href="http://farristate.com/WebsiteChart/myTutorials.txt" target="_blank"> this</a> text file containing the time and % CPU. There are 4 main pieces that make this work starting with the Linux command mpstat. 
                </p>
                <p>
                You can type in <mark>mpstat</mark> into your linux command line and hit enter and the image below will be your result. This actually breaks down into what type of processes are keeping your processor busy. Without any arguments on your mpstat command it outputs the average since your computer last restarted. 
                </p>
                </h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-10 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
            <img src="/images/mpstatA.PNG">
            <h4>
            <p>
            The next image is the result of issuing the command <mark>mpstat 2 5</mark>. This means the server takes the average CPU usage over each 2 second period and prints it. Then it averages all the periods and prints that last. More information on the mpstat command can be found <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/mpstat1.html" target="_blank"> here</a>.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/mpstatC.PNG">
            <p>
            Since we have the ability to tell the current CPU usage we need to now store it repeatedly. The java program calls the command <mark>mpstat 5 1</mark> and then adds its result the current text file. Read through the program’s comments if you’d like more details on how this is accomplished. 
            </p>

                I promise I don't normally comment java like this but unfortunately it seems my syntax highlighter doesn't
                quite like normal multi line comments.

                There’s one last hurdle that has to be crossed for the CPU usage text file to be continuously updated. We needed to add our Java program to the Linux cron scheduler but the built in scheduler will only run a command every minute. We want our CPU usage updated every 5 seconds but cron is not built for such frequent calls. Instead of changing the Java program to loop 12 times in a minute, which could lead to uneven updates to the CPU text file, I let cron run a short bash script every minute. This script guarantees that the java program will run every 5 seconds in the background. The & symbol at the end of the called command means that the command will be run in the background and not take time before the script sleeps for 5 seconds.
